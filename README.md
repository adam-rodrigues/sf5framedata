# Street Fighter 5 Frame Data Mobile App

This is a self made android application allowing one to quickly check move frame data for characters in SFV. Due to this being a passion project I have no intention to release the app full because of potential database costs, but I have added code snippets in the repository to showcase the code used to create the final product.

### Languages & Tools Used
* Python
* Java
* Firestore
