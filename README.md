# Street Fighter 5 Frame Data Mobile App

This is a self made android application allowing one to quickly check move frame data for characters in SFV. Due to this being a passion project, I have no intention of releasing the app because of potential database costs. I have added code snippets in the repository to showcase the code used to create the final product.

### Languages & Tools Used
* Python (Used to initialize database)
* Java
* Firestore
* Android Studio

### Screenshots
